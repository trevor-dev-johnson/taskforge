TaskForge

TaskForge is a backend API for managing projects and tasks inside an organization.

It was built to demonstrate real-world backend engineering using Python and FastAPI, with a focus on clean architecture, strong data modeling, and service-layer business logic.

This project is intentionally backend-only and prioritizes correctness, maintainability, and production-style design.
